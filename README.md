# huatR

`huatR` (**H**appy **U**sing **a**nd **T**inkering with `R`)[^1]
contains `R` functions that I use in my projects. Please note that
`huatR` functions are specifically written for the specific needs of the
author (which explains the self-serving `yh` prefix) and are probably
**not** of interest to most (88.888888 + 8.88888888 + 0.88888888 +
0.088888888 $\approx$ 98.7% [^2]) people.

## Installation

That said, if you still wish to use it[^3], you can install the
development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("yhpua/huatR")
```

## Example

``` r
# library(huatR)
# yhnmsd(data = mtcars, mydv = "qsec", dtpoint = "am", tgroup = "vs")
```

Good Luck & Huat ah!!

    8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_numerology#Eight)

[^3]: I am not being
    [**pantang**](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pantang) here but the
    codes are likely to balk. So, the *caveat emptor* principle applies!
