# huatR

`huatR` (**H**appy **U**sing **a**nd **T**inkering with `R`)[^1]
contains `R` functions that I use in my projects. I have finally
appreciated the advantages of creating a package to manage one’s R
functions. `huatR` functions are specifically written for the specific
needs of the author (hence the self-serving `yh` prefix) and are
probably **not** of interest to most (88.888888 + 8.88888888 +
0.88888888 + 0.088888888% = 98.7% [^2]) people.

## Installation

That said, if you still wish to use it (`NO PANTANG`[^3] but *caveat
emptor*!), you can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("yhpua/huatR")
```

## Example

``` r
library(huatR)
pmtoc()
#> 
#> Yonghao miscellaneous R functions  
#> 
#> Descriptive Stats  
#> 
#> yhnmsd() generates descriptive stats
#> yhround() round numbers
#> 
#> 
#> 
#> Missing values  
#> 
#> yhareg generates formula to be used in aregimpute() 
#> 
#> 
#> 
```
